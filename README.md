# odin-recipes
This is my first ever web development project, combining all the basics of html I have learned thus far through the Odin project into a comprehensive website.
This website is intended to be a site where users can visit to view and learn how to make my personal recipes I make at home.
In doing this project I not only apply the html I have learned so far, but also how to correctly utilize git and github in tandem to store snapshots of the project. I am hoping to further polish these new skills as I continue onward.
