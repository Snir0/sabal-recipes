        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Savory chicken breast paired with a delicious, complex mango sauce. I created this recipe blind, and I really truly believe that
            this sauce is one of the best things I will ever make in my life. The savory chicken melts in your mouth while the sauce coats your tongue, introducing
            sweet, sour, tart, and spicy to complement the chicken. <strong>It's pretty good.</strong>
